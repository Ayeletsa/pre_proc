middle line calib of the 200m tunnel, measured at the top part of the tunnel (edge of the inverted v shape).
all datapoints should be good, the tag was always in the middle.
All 14 anchors were working well, including the sun tower (229), observatory point (110) and hill (228).
We should have Z information!
The calibration should be good for Sami and Somo (bats 2289 and 9861), though not all recording days of those bats had full 14 anchors set, and also only from the 30/06/2018 we corrected some anchors positions and antenna offsets.
They could also be used with Photino and Ace (9871 and 0034), though we had several changes such as additional anchor on the sun tower working and correction of anchors positions and antenna offsets.
